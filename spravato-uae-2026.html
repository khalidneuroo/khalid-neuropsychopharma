    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Abstract</h3>
    <p style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        This clinical research investigates the use of advanced pharmacological interventions in the United Arab Emirates
        for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) or treatment‑resistant depression (TRD) who have not
        responded adequately to standard treatments. The primary focus is on evaluating the clinical effectiveness of
        Spravato (esketamine), an NMDA receptor antagonist developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, in alleviating depressive
        symptoms in this population within a real‑world clinical setting in Dubai.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Background</h3>
    <p style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        Treatment‑resistant depression remains a major clinical challenge, with a subset of patients showing limited or
        no response to conventional antidepressant regimens. Novel agents such as esketamine, which modulate glutamatergic
        neurotransmission via NMDA receptor antagonism, have emerged as potential options for individuals who do not
        benefit from traditional monoaminergic therapies. This study is positioned within the context of the UAE’s growing
        adoption of advanced psychiatric treatments and aims to document outcomes in a local clinical environment.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Objectives</h3>
    <ul style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        <li><strong>Primary Objective:</strong> To determine whether treatment with Spravato leads to a measurable reduction
            in depressive symptoms in patients with MDD or TRD who have not responded to prior treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Objectives:</strong> To observe changes in functional status, tolerability, and overall
            clinical impression during the treatment period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Methods</h3>
    <p style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        The study follows a clinical observational framework in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder or
        treatment‑resistant depression who are receiving Spravato as part of their therapeutic plan in Dubai. Symptom
        severity is monitored using standardized depression rating scales over the course of treatment, with assessments
        conducted at baseline and at predefined follow‑up intervals between January and March 2026. Data collection focuses
        on symptom change, response patterns, and overall clinical trajectory.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Outcome Measures</h3>
    <ul style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        <li><strong>Primary Outcome:</strong> Change in depressive symptom scores from baseline to end of observation.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Outcomes:</strong> Proportion of responders and partial responders, qualitative reports of
            symptom relief, and clinician‑rated global improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Significance</h3>
    <p style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        This research represents one of the early structured efforts in the UAE to document the clinical impact of
        esketamine‑based treatment in patients with limited response to conventional therapies. Findings are expected to
        contribute to a better understanding of how advanced pharmacological strategies can be integrated into regional
        mental health practice and may inform future protocols, larger studies, and translational work in neuropsychopharmacology.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:#00ff88;">Notes</h3>
    <p style="color:#e0ffe0;">
        This study is ongoing and parameters, analyses, and interpretations are subject to refinement as additional data
        are collected between January and March 2026.
